# Twitter-Scrapping-using-snscrape
🙌Hi friends in this project I created web application using Streamlit fucntion to view the extracted twitter data and uploaded into MongoDB to save the data in the format of CSV/JSON in our local file.

→ First of all I installed the sncrape and created function to scrape tweets from twitter.

→ After I created funtion of 'scrape twitter data' using Python and programmed basic functions of scrapping twitter data.

→ Then appended all extracted tweet in the  dictionary format.

→ After I created function of 'insert into MongoDB' and  inserted the tweet into MongoDB database using Pymongo and Mongoclient by creating database and collection.

→ Same way I created the  functions of CSV/JSON to convert the extracted tweets into CVS and JSON format. 

→ Finnaly I created the web application using Streamlit to visualize the tweets step by step.

→ Hi friends I believe all you are enjoyed my code.Thank you👍.
